Inject.setExpires(minutes);
{% endhighlight %}

Specifies a number of minutes that items should persist in localStorage. A value of **0** can be used to ensure no files are retained in localStorage, useful for development.

Setting a value of **0** while items are in localStorage will cause the items in localStorage to be ignored.
