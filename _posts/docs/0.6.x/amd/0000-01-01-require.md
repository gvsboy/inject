AMD specifies an alternate syntax for require, which takes an array of dependencies, followed by a callback function which receives the list of paramters in the order they were listed. Key builtins of `require`, `module`, and `exports` won't resolve to modules, but instead will resolve to their matching module counterparts. It's behavior is very similar in design to [require.ensure](/docs/0.6.x/api/require.ensure.html).
